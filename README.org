* Introduction
Mini-CI is a small daemon to perform continuous integration (CI) for a single repository/project.  Most other CI software is complicated to setup and use due to feature bloat and hiding what is going on underneath with GUIs.  If you know how to build your project from the command line, setting up Mini-CI should be easy.
* Features

  - Configuration is done with a small config file and shell scripts.
  - Daemon controlled through a command.
